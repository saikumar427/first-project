            and account information, such as name, company name, address, phone
            number, e-mail address, password , in addition to financial and billing
            information, such as billing name, address and credit card number.
            When you express interest in additional information, when you register
            for the Services, or after you become a user, we may ask for additional
            personal information, such as title, mobile number, fax number or
            additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of
            employees or industry. You can opt out of providing additional information
            by not entering it when asked.
            <p>Eventbee does not distribute or share customer e-mail addresses,
              except as noted in its Terms of Service, or as may be required by
              law.</p>
            <p>Eventbee uses the information we collect to set up the Services
              for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information
              to contact customers and prospects to further discuss their interest
              in our company, the Services we provide and ways we can improve
              them, and to send information such as announcements of promotions
              and events regarding our company or partners. We may also e-mail
              a customer newsletter and updates about the Services or the company.
              You can opt out of receiving these communications by replying to
              them at the time they are distributed or at any time by e-mailing
              support@eventbee.com.</p>
            <p>All financial and billing information that we collect through a
              Eventbee Web site and the Services is used solely to bill for the
              Services. Eventbee does not use this billing information for marketing
              or promotional purposes. Except as we explicitly state at the time
              we request information, or as provided for in the Eventbee Terms
              of Service, we do not disclose to any third party the information
              provided.</p>
            <p>Eventbee has referral relationships with third-party companies
              and individuals (&quot;Referral Partners&quot;) who refer their
              customers to Eventbee. Customers who become paying users of a Eventbee
              online software through a Referral Partner are considered customers
              of both Eventbee and the Referral Partner. Eventbee and a Referral
              Partner may share customer contact as well as account, financial
              and billing information with respect to their joint business relationship
              with the customer. The sharing of this information allows Eventbee
              and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the shared
              customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows
              Referral Partners to provide consolidated billing services to the
              shared customer. Shared contact and account, financial and billing
              information is governed by the Eventbee Terms of Service. Eventbee
              does not share your business data with Referral Partners.</p>
            <p>Eventbee has integration relationships with third-party companies
              and individuals (&quot;Partners&quot;). These relationships extend
              the functionality of the Services and the Integration Partner application
              or service (&quot;Integrated Service&quot;) by allowing the Services
              and the Integrated Service to exchange customer data and to establish
              linked business processes between the two. Customers who pay Eventbee
              for use of the Services and use this Integrated Service are considered
              customers of both Eventbee and the Partner. Eventbee and Partner
              may share customer contact, account, financial and billing information,
              and business data with respect to their integrated business relationship
              with the customer. The sharing of this information allows Eventbee
              and the Partner to establish the identity of the shared customer
              and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows the Partner
              to provide consolidated billing services to the shared customer
              and allows for the enhanced functionality of the integrated service.
              Shared contact, account, financial and billing information, and
              business data is governed by the Eventbee Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>Eventbee uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card
              processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution
              chain and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information
              provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.
              Eventbee does not store customer credit card information on its
              servers.</p>
            <p><br>
              Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide information
              on a Eventbee Web site, but they are not permitted to collect any
              information, nor does Eventbee share any personally identifiable
              user information with these parties.</p>
            <p>Eventbee customers use Eventbee online software to host data and
              information. Eventbee will not review, share, distribute, print,
              or reference any such data except as provided in the Eventbee Terms
              of Service, or as may be required by law. We will view or access
              individual records only with your permission (for example, to resolve
              a problem or support issue). Of course, users of the Services are
              responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of
              their user registration and passwords.</p>
            <p>Eventbee may also collect certain information from visitors to
              a Eventbee Web site and customers of the Services, such as Internet
              addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical
              problems and to administer the Eventbee Web site and Services in
              order to constantly improve quality. We may also track and analyze
              non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information
              from visitors and customers and provide such information to third
              parties.<br>

            information using both server authentication and data encryption to

            also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data

            server environment using a firewall and other advanced technology
            to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally,
            Eventbee requires unique user names and passwords that must be entered
            each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized
