            <p>Partners promote your events in two ways</p>
            <p><b>1. Web Promotion</b></p>
            <p>Partners copy and paste custom URL links and buttons on their web 
              site or blog. Various settings under this option allows you to control 
              how Partner can sell tickets from the Web.</p>
            <p>Default settings under this section:</p>
            <p>* 100% commission to Partner - Here Partner receives all the commission 
              set by you on each Ticket sale.</p>
            <p>* Deny permission to change commission settings by Partner - By 
              default Partner is not allowed to change commission settings or 
              pass commission to the Attendee. You can change this default setting 
              to allow Partner to change commission settings.</p>
            <p><b>2. Social Promotion</b></p>
            <p>Partners promote events to their Social Graph by publishing event 
              feeds to Facebook profile, inviting friends with embedded custom 
              URL links etc. Various settings under this option allows you to 
              control how the Partner can sell tickets using this feature.</p>
            <p>Default settings under this section:</p>
            <p>* 50-50% commission split between Partner and Attendee - Here Partner 
              receives 50% of the commission as earnings and Attendee receives 
              50% of commission as a discount towards event registration.</p>
            <p>* Deny permission to change commission settings by Partner - By 
              default Partner is not allowed to change commission settings. However 
              you can allow Partner to change commission settings.</p>
            <p>NOTE: These are default global settings for all Partners, having 
              said that, you can modify these default settings on any Partner 
              case by case basis.</p>
