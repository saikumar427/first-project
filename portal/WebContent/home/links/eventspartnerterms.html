			<p>Welcome to the EventBee Partner Network Program. By enrolling in the EventBee Partner Network Beta Program (?Beta Program?), you are entering into a legally binding agreement with EventBee, Inc.This agreement is comprised solely of these Terms and Conditions (?Agreement? or ?Terms?), including anything explicitly incorporated by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not enroll in the Partner Network Program.</p>

			<p>You and EventBee agree to the following:</p>

			<p>1. Definitions</p>
			<p>EventBee Streamer: Streamer is served by Deshub that contains URL links and/or other content.</p>

			<p>You or you: the entity that is enrolling in the Beta Program.
			Your Site: the web site(s) that You own that contain webpages that include the Streamer Code.
			Web Page: Your website page where you display Streamer.</p>
			<p>EventBee Streamer Code:  Streamer code is a Javascript code (or any other form of specified code) provided by EventBee to you with unique ID embedded.</p>

			<p>2. Your Responsibilities</p>

			<p>You agree to comply with EventBee's Policies and any other policies or requirements we establish from time to time.</p>
			<p>You are responsible for obtaining all equipment, web access and connections necessary for you to participate in the Partner Program and for (i) hosting Your Site and (ii) managing at your own expense.
			You are responsible for proper configuration of Your Site to include the Streamer Code and to receive Streamer, and for meeting all other technical requirements necessary to use the Partner Program services.
			You agree to notify EventBee of any disputed or missing payment within thirty (30) days of the date that payment is or should have been received. You understand that you will have waived the right to dispute the accuracy or receipt of payment after that time.</p>
			<p>3. Implementation</p>
			<p>If there is any conflict between these implementation requirements and a Policy, you should comply with the Policy instead, but only to the extent of the conflict.
			You agree to allow your Web Pages to send EventBee a Query each time that a user navigates to Web Page, and you agree not to send additional Queries until the user refreshes the Web  Page or navigates to a new Web Page. You acknowledge that we may suspend services under this Agreement in the event we detect a spike in the number of Queries from Your Site; and
			You agree that you will: (i) not modify the Streamer in any way; (ii) display the Streamer at the same time that you display the other content on the WebPage. You understand that we may modify the content, look and feel, and any other aspect of the Streamer from time to time, in our sole discretion.
			You agree that you will not distribute from or promote on Your Sites any software application that is (or may reasonably be construed as) spyware, adware or trackware.</p>

			<p>4. Exclusivity</p>

			<p> For any webpage that includes Streamer, you agree not to display or link to any other advertising (including but not limited to any listing) that is mapped to or responds to the content of the Web Page.</p>

			<p>5. Payment</p>
			<p>EventBee's payment to you will be 80% of partner network program revenue earned by EventBee from the sales originated from Your Site.

			Each time that we send you a payment, we incur administrative and other costs. For this reason, we will not send you a payment if the amount owed to you is less than $100. If your participation in the Partner Program terminates, we will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to send you a final payment if the amount owed to you exceeds $100. We reserve the right to offset any amount owed to you by the amount of EventBee's damages if we terminate for cause.</p>

			<p>As much as we would like to, we cannot pay you if we do not have your correct payment and contact information or if you modify the Streamer Code in any way. Payment is contingent on your keeping us updated with current and accurate payment and contact information including, without limitation, valid tax payer identification number or social security number, and valid bank account information. We reserve the right to terminate this Agreement in the event that we are unable to verify the accuracy or validity of any of the foregoing.</p>


			<p>You will be responsible for all taxes and governmental fees of any kind that are imposed on or arise out of your participation in the Partner Program.
			We may offset any payment by (i) any amount you owe to EventBee, its parent company and its subsidiaries and affiliates; and (ii) any fees or charges that result from your failure to provide EventBee with accurate payment information or your failure to update your information.</p>

			<p>6. Changes and Updates</p>
			<p>EventBee needs to have the freedom to make strategic and business decisions about the Partner Program (and all related and successor programs). For this reason, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change all or part of these Terms and/or the Policies and to change or discontinue the Partner Program, including but not limited to raising or lowering the rate of compensation, changing the basis of compensation and/or changing the payment schedule. We may make these changes at any time, with or without notice. Your continued participation in the Partner Program will constitute your acceptance of the then-current terms and conditions, Policies and service offerings.
